# medical-info-gain
This project has two parts.<br>
<b>Part 1:</b> Creates a relation in MySQL database (using Java) to hold a set of mutations that will be analyzed in part 2.<br>
<b>Part 2:</b> (Data Mining & Analysis) Finds the gene mutation that is mostly likely the cause of death / most likely a factor to links to death in patients by calculating information gains in a real set of medical data hosted in an Oracle database.<br><br>
The result is also in the included word document in this repository.
<br>
<strong>Goal: Learn to use Java to connect to MySQL and Oracle databases and then manipulates data in the databases to find information gains. </strong><br>
<em>Technologies used: Java, MySQL, and Oracle DB.</em>
