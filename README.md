# medical-info-gain
This project has two parts.<br>
<b>Part 1:</b> Creates a relation in MySQL database (using Java) to hold a set of mutations that will be analyzed in part 2.<br>
<b>Part 2:</b> (Data Mining & Analysis) Finds the gene mutation that is mostly likely the cause of death / most likely a factor to links to death in patients by calculating information gains in a real set of medical data hosted in an Oracle database.<br><br>
The result is also in the included word document in this repository.
<br><br>
<strong>Goal: Learn to use Java to connect to MySQL and Oracle databases and then manipulates data in the databases to find information gains. </strong><br><br>
<em>Technologies used: Java, MySQL, and Oracle DB.</em>

<br>
<strong>To run the code:</strong>
<br>
1) The first part of the project creates a table that holds the 10 mutations in your local MySQL database. You will need to first download the included MySQL connector and possibly put it in the lib folder in NetBeans<br>
<br>
2) The second part also needs the MySQL connector as well as the Oracle DB connector. Both connectors are already included in this repository. The path to the Oracle DB is already in the .java file. If my school still holds the data, the link will work. Thank you.
